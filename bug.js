This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when a component renders before the asynchronous operation that sets the state has completed. For example, imagine fetching data from an API inside a `useEffect` hook. If you try to render the fetched data before the `fetch` promise resolves, you'll get a `undefined is not an object` error.
